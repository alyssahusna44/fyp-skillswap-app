# UniKL Skillswap – Final Year Project by Alyssa & Azwin

**UniKL SkillSwap** is an app developed as a Final Year Project for Universiti Kuala Lumpur. We plan so that the app enables users to find tutors easier online.

## Tech Stack

This project uses **Flutter** for the frontend and **Supabase** as the backend. The backend manages user data, skill listings, chat functionality, and user reviews.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The backend and frontend services (including the Supabase database) are still under active development. Features and data structures may change as the project evolves.
